		<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 15px; color: #BA4F00; text-align: center;">
		I used to work at a local fruit market. 
		I had to restock and help customers pick out the produce.
		I learned how to pick out a good watermelon by slapping it.
		I also unloaded trucks and put the items into a cooler.
		Sometimes I would deliever sandwiches, too.
